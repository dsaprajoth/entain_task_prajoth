Worth another chance. ZINFANDEL EVIE (7) is a well performed dog and winner of 25 races who is worth forgiving after finishing out of the placings at Angle Park (19.93). Has a good record here at this journey. The form from her last run stacks up well. Can figure in the finish. SPLIT VISION (1) has performed well at his last couple of runs here, most recently when second beaten 1.5 lengths (23.01). Leading player again. PINK CONFETTI (4) won in the best time of the program last time out. Sure to run well again."
