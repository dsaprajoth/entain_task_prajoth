The winkers replace the blinkers for the first time and even from a wide gate, he is the one to beat. CATMISS (8) showed ability as a juvenile before being put aside to mature. She looked in good nick when winning a recent Rockhampton trial and despite a tough draw, she can figure in the finish. HEZA ROMEO (3) showed abundant pace in 2 starts as a juvenile. He resumes from a spell and will be a lot stronger this season. A good draw helps and Adrian Layt is keeping the faith. Hard to beat. MYTHBUSTA (5) had a busy juvenile prep and has since moved North to join the Bowen stable of Tom Button. He will have no problem with a wet track and with Ash Butler in the irons, he can make a positive start to this campaign.",
